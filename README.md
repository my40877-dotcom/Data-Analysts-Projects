🚀 QuickBite Express: Crisis Recovery Dashboard
New Data Analyst Project | Food-Tech Startup Recovery Strategy
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on QuickBite Express, a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup that faced a major crisis in June 2025 due to food safety violations and delivery outages. As a Data Analyst, I developed a dynamic dashboard to analyze order patterns, financial impact, and customer sentiment to guide their recovery strategy.




🛠️ Tech Stack & Process

Data Source: Sourced from the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge.



Analysis: Used Python and Pandas for data cleaning and period-based categorization (Pre-Crisis vs. Crisis).

Visualization: Created an interactive UI using Streamlit and Plotly.

Problem Solving: Leveraged Gemini as an AI thought partner to debug technical errors (e.g., KeyError: Phase) and refine dashboard logic.

📊 Visual Insights
1. Revenue & Financial Impact
The crisis led to a staggering 71% drop in revenue, falling from ₹38M to ₹11M.

2. Monthly Order Trends
Daily order volume crashed from ~23k to ~8.5k per month starting in June 2025.

3. Operational Gaps (SLA & Cancellations)
On-time delivery compliance plummeted from 40%+ to nearly 10% during the monsoon delivery outage.

4. High-Value Customer Churn
Identified an 84% loss among the top 5% of spenders, totaling 3,647 VIP users who stopped ordering entirely.

5. Sentiment & Feedback
Customer trust hit an all-time low with an average rating of 2.5⭐. Top negative keywords included "Food safety" and "Safety issue".

💡 Key Actionable Insights
VIP Recovery: Launch a high-incentive retention campaign targeting the 3,647 churned high-value users.

Logistics Stabilization: Overhaul delivery infrastructure to handle monsoon disruptions and restore the 10% SLA compliance back to pre-crisis levels.

Trust Building: Market the "overhauled food safety protocols" to address the specific "safety" concerns raised in customer reviews.

🎓 Personal Reflection
As my first personal project, this taught me how to:

Connect disparate data tables (Orders, Customers, Performance) to find the "Why" behind a business failure.

Use AI tools like Gemini to efficiently troubleshoot code and learn professional UI/UX standards.

Focus on actionable insights rather than just creating "pretty charts."

Developed as part of a learning journey to master Data Analytics.
